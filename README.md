## Key Elements of the Code

## Variables and Data Segments:

seconds, timerflag, jump_flag, resume_flag, timerBrickFlag: These variables are used for managing timers and flags for various game events like jumping and resuming.

brikCurr, brikStartPos, brikRange, brikfinalPos: These variables control the position and range of bricks in the game.

rabitPos, carrot: Track the position of the rabbit and the carrots on the grid.

colorsRange, colorIndex1, colorIndex2: These variables manage color changes, likely for visual effects.

## Subroutines:

delay: This routine creates a delay in the execution, likely used to control the speed of game events.

DesiredLocation: Computes the memory location on the display for a specific grid position.

Division: Handles the display of elements on the screen, setting up graphics memory and drawing objects like bricks and carrots.

Bricks: Manages the display of bricks, drawing them at specific locations on the screen.

Carrot: Similar to Bricks, this routine handles the display of carrots on the screen.

## Potential Functionalities

The game logic involves:

Jumping: The rabbit can jump over obstacles, possibly bricks.

Collecting Carrots: The rabbit collects carrots, which may increase the score.

Brick Interaction: Bricks might act as obstacles or barriers in the game.

## Purpose of the Project

The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, interactive game using assembly language, demonstrating a deep understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and handling hardware interrupts (for timers and display).
